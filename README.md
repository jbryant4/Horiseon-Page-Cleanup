# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Fix link in the header
I found from a basic look at the website that one of the links did not work. After looking at the code, I found that one of the sections did not have the proper id.

## Edits made to head
Just changed the website name to Horiseon Main 

## Edits made to the body
The body was div soup as they would say so took it step by step and cleaned up the html and the css at the same time. I also organized the css so that it would flow similar to the html page. 

### header and footer

This change was rather simple changed two of the divs in the header to header and nav(for the search bar). Lastly changed the div in the footer to footer.

### body sections

This is where most of the changes happened. The Hero section was not a lot to change. But the Content and Benifit part of the code needed a little more work. There was a lot of divs in these body parts. I changed the outer most div to section and gave it the same class as the dev before. Then I changed the divs on the inside that to articles. From there i notice that the css had a lot of similar and repeating sections, so i have all the articles in each section set to the same class. This freed up a lot of space in my css.
